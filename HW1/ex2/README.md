## Idea
1. Histogram Equalization
2. extract certain HSV ranges
3. binarization
4. do open operation to remove disturbance
5. do close operation to connect the upper part and the lower part of the apple together, since they are different in color
6. draw the outline
## Interesting feature
- used the trackbar to determine the HSV range dynamically
- I respectively extracted the upper & lower part of the apple.
