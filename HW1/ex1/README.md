# ex1
learnt from He Zhewen.
## How to use
chmod +x ./ex1.sh
./ex1.sh + path of the file
## Idea
1. Use find and grep to look for .c/.h files that contain "hello"
- find command can search for all the files in the current folder and its subfolders
2. Use $1 to receive the perimeter the user gives, in order to search in the given folder
3. use for loop to count the total number of files
4. use data to calculate the total time used
